## Project Description
ExplainIt AI is a web-based educational tool designed to help middle-school and high-school students truly understand their homework instead of memorizing answers. Students enter a question, select their grade level, and receive clear, step-by-step explanations that focus on reasoning and learning rather than answer copying.

The platform uses Gemini AI to generate educational explanations that explain what to do, why each step matters, and how solutions are reached. ExplainIt AI demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used responsibly as a learning assistant to improve comprehension and confidence.
